# Addons for the _Crown of the Oathbreaker_ campaign module

This module is a companions module for the **_Crown of the Oathbreaker_** Foundry VTT module. It porovides :

- **Modular maps with tiles.** New Kingdom of Aglarion and Onadbyr maps with tiles, so that the GM can toggle their visibility when needed, for exemple when the players discover a place. The Onadbyr map (pre-curse) also uses new map pins in line with the ones in the books.
- **New journal sheet.** It uses a CSS stylesheet, so that the journals visual style match the one of the published books. The only journals provided are for the _Introduction_, _Kingom of Aglarion_ and _Onadbyr_ parts of the official Module. Those are already readily available on the Elderbrain site in the sample PDF for **_Crown of the Oathbreaker_**.
- **New rollable table.** They take advantage of nested tables so that you can roll for random encounters in one click instead of two.
